# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## What i want
This project created as basic todo app to train fsd design with react

## Plan
I got a few steps of programming:
1. Create components architecture
2. Make components usable, add logic for tasks
3. Refactor Js into Typescrypt
4. Add drag`n grop effect for tasks
5. Add color theme togler
6. Add node backend

## During the project 
### Problems 
* Aliases was not working with vs code links
> I found solution, now my project contains jsconfig.json file
* I have big problems with spliting something in fsd methodology. Mostly it is a features VS entities VS widgets
> Practice solve any problem
* Tyred facing stupid js problems
> At this moment started learning Typescript 

### New knowledges in different technologies
* Aliasses support in intelisense
* Folowing aliases link in vs code
* Js config file and alieases support in this file
* Typescript (finally)
* FSD (Feature-Sliced-Design)
* Improved import / export skills
